## 🛡 Security Features

The **CTD Custom Code Box** plugin includes built-in security measures to protect your site:

- **Shortcode Restriction:** Only administrators can execute shortcodes to prevent unauthorized usage.
- **Nonce Verification:** Protects against CSRF attacks by verifying security tokens for all critical actions.
- **Admin Request Validation:** Ensures that only users with proper permissions can access settings and perform administrative actions.
- **Secure AJAX Requests:** Uses `check_ajax_referer()` to validate AJAX operations.
- **Sanitized Inputs:** All user inputs are sanitized before being processed to prevent malicious data injection.
- **Escaped Output:** Prevents XSS attacks by escaping all outputted data.
- **Custom Capability Checks:** Restricts sensitive operations to users with `manage_options` capability.
- **Strict Form Handling:** Verifies POST requests, ensuring they come from trusted sources and contain valid nonces.
- **No External Dependencies:** The plugin exclusively uses internal resources, eliminating reliance on third-party scripts or services, making it even safer.

##  Usage
